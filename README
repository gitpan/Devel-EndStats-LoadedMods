NAME
    Devel::EndStats::LoadedMods - Display run time and dependencies after
    running code

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of Devel::EndStats::LoadedMods
    (from Perl distribution Devel-EndStats-LoadedMods), released on
    2014-10-09.

SYNOPSIS
     # from the command line
     % perl -MDevel::EndStats::LoadedMods script.pl

     ##### sample output #####
     <normal script output, if any...>

     # BEGIN stats from Devel::EndStats::LoadedMods

     # END stats

DESCRIPTION
    This module installs an END block to dump a list of loaded modules with
    their versions. It simply lists the content of %INC keys, with versions
    taken from corresponding $VERSION package variables. The output is
    easily diff-able.

    I first wrote this to debug why my script doesn't work when run under
    cron (using system perl) but works when run under my shell (using
    perlbrew's perl).

SEE ALSO
    There are probably already existing modules on CPAN when I wrote this
    module, but I couldn't find them.

    Related modules to print information at the end of program run:
    Devel::EndStats.
